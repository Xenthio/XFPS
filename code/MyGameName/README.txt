Put your game specific code in your own folder, e.g. MyGameName.

// Xenthio and 3T note: we want to share this codebase across as many projects as possible.
// For a (source style) multi game repo, structure stuff like this
// |- code
//    |- TerrorTown
//      |- (TTT specific code).cs
//    |- WetWork
//      |- (WetWork specific code)cs
//    |- (Shared code).cs
// Why maintain the similar code/desired outcome of 8 games when we can maintain 1?
